#1. Create a list of integers (you get to pick!). Write code to iterate through the list and calculate the sum of all even numbers. Print the resulting sum.


# Create a list of integers
numbers = [4, 7, 10, 13, 2, 8, 5]

# Variable to store the sum of even numbers
even_sum = 0

# Loop through each number in the list
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        even_sum += num  # Add it if it's even

# Print the result
print("The sum of all even numbers is:", even_sum)
